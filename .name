The Malac Blockchain and Handra Coin: Inspired by C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy

The name "Malac" draws inspiration from the planet "Malacandra" featured in C.S. Lewis' beloved Space Trilogy. In the fictional language of Old Solar, "Malacandra" translates to "land of Mars."  The "Malac" prefix in "The Malac Blockchain" captures the essence of this beautiful and harmonious world from the books.

The name "Handra Coin" goes deeper into the etymology of "Malacandra." "Handra" is the Old Solar word for "earth," "land," or "planet," directly reflecting Malacandra's nature. 

Therefore, "The Malac Blockchain" and "Handra Coin" pay homage to C.S. Lewis' rich imagination while signifying a new technological frontier for a connected and harmonious future.
